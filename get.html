        <h2>How to Sign Up for Medicare Based on Your Situation</h2>
        <p>Medicare is a federal health insurance program primarily for people aged 65 or older...</p>

                <p>If you are already receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits, you will be automatically enrolled in Medicare when you turn 65. You will receive a Medicare card in the mail about three months before your birthday. Automatic enrollment includes Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance), but Part B requires a monthly premium. If you don’t want Part B, you must notify Medicare. Those with disabilities, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), or Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) may have different enrollment rules. Automatic enrollment ensures you don’t miss your coverage start date, but it's important to review your options carefully. If you wish to delay enrollment because you have employer coverage, you should contact Medicare to understand potential penalties.</p>

            <h3>Manual Enrollment</h3>
            <p>If you are not receiving Social Security or RRB benefits, you must manually sign up...</p>

                <p>If you are not automatically enrolled in Medicare, you will need to sign up manually when you become eligible. You can apply for Medicare online through the Social Security Administration website, by calling Social Security, or by visiting a local office. You should sign up during your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP), which starts three months before your 65th birthday and lasts for seven months. If you miss this period, you may have to wait for the General Enrollment Period (GEP) from January 1 to March 31, and your coverage will begin on July 1. Late enrollment may result in penalties, increasing your premium permanently. If you have employer-based insurance, you might be able to delay Part B without penalty, but you should check with Medicare to confirm.</p>

            <h3>Enrollment Periods</h3>
            <p>Understand the different enrollment periods like IEP, GEP, and SEP.</p>
            <input type="checkbox" id="toggle3" class="toggle-input">
            <label for="toggle3" class="toggle-btn">View Periods</label>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p>Medicare enrollment occurs during specific periods. The Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) is a seven-month window that begins three months before you turn 65, includes your birth month, and continues for three months afterward. If you miss your IEP, you can enroll during the General Enrollment Period (GEP), which runs from January 1 to March 31 each year, but late enrollment may lead to penalties. A Special Enrollment Period (SEP) is available for those who have qualifying circumstances, such as employer-based insurance, allowing them to enroll without penalties. If you qualify for SEP, you have eight months to enroll in Part B after your employer coverage ends. Understanding these periods helps ensure timely coverage and avoids unnecessary penalties.</p>

            <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
            <p>Those qualifying due to disability, ESRD, or ALS may have different enrollment rules.</p>
            <input type="checkbox" id="toggle4" class="toggle-input">
            <label for="toggle4" class="toggle-btn">Check Eligibility</label>
            <div class="hidden-content">
                <p>Medicare eligibility isn’t just for those turning 65. If you have a disability and have received Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for at least 24 months, you automatically qualify for Medicare. Those diagnosed with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) qualify for Medicare regardless of age, but must apply manually. ESRD patients need dialysis or a kidney transplant to qualify. Individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) automatically qualify for Medicare when they start receiving SSDI benefits. If you fall into any of these categories, it’s essential to understand your enrollment options and timelines. Some conditions may have specific rules about when coverage begins, so reviewing eligibility requirements with Medicare is crucial.</p>
